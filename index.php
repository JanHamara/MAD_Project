                One Sunday evening, when I was browsing <strong>Medium</strong> (fantastic website
                that curates some of the best articles on the internet on various topics), I came across
                an <a class="link-main" href="https://medium.com/personal-finance-series-by-richard-reis/how-to-become-a-millionaire-19b1421a50a1" target="_blank">
                    article</a> discussing <strong>how one could realistically become a millionaire</strong>. It was talking about
                some of the most important principles for achieving this goal, among which three stood out in my view.
                These were talking about <strong>living below your means</strong>,
                <strong>thinking long term</strong> and <strong>having more than one source of income</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                It really got me thinking about conditions that accompany each person on their way to the first million
                and why only so few reach this goal. After a bit more of browsing around, I have found an <a class="link-main" href="https://www.inc.com/business-insider/36-million-millionaires-in-the-world-hold-46-percent-wealth-credit-suisse-global-wealth-report-2017.html" target="_blank">
                    online report</a> from Credit Suisse that was showing how there were <strong>2.3 million new millionaires in the world in 2016</strong>,
                putting the total at <strong>36 million</strong> millionaires in the world (2016)<a class="mad-ref-link" href="#mad-ref-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
                That makes up less than <strong>1%</strong> of the world's population, however,
                this one percent owns the same amount of wealth as <strong>46% of the world</strong>.
                </p>

                Despite the widely discussed fact that <a class="link-main" href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130326-why-money-cant-buy-you-happiness" target="_blank">
                    money cannot buy you happiness</a>, everybody would surely like to be a part of this one percent
                and become a millionaire in their lifetime. And that got me thinking about a question...
                </p>

                <p>
                Depending on the environment (country) that you're coming from, having an average lifestyle
                and by simple decision of lowering your expenses as much as possible while keeping an average standard of living -
                <strong>COULD YOU ACHIEVE IT IN A LIFETIME?</strong>
                </p>

                <p>I have decided to conduct research and gather enough data to be able to determine
                    <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">which countries wages and living conditions would allow a person to earn first million in fastest time
                        and on the other side, which country would be the worst choice.</strong>

                <p>
                    There is an uncountable number of factors that can influence a journey to a point,
                    when a person can be defined as a <strong>'milionaire'</strong>. Therefore, there are several standards
                    and definitions that are needed to be explained first - to show how this research presents
                    gathered results in order to answer the set question.
                </p>

                <ol id="mad-preparation-standards">

                            <p>
                                <em>Being a millionaire</em> doesn't have to mean <em>being rich</em>
                                in certain countries of the world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While millionaire in <strong>France</strong> ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·(net worth bigger than <strong>1 000 000 â‚¬</strong>) is certainly considered worldwide as an extremely wealthy individual,
                                if we take for second example a person in <strong>Indonesia</strong> ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© - their <strong>1 000 000 Rp</strong>
                                (Indonesian Rupiah) is barely worth <strong>62â‚¬</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This means that the actual wealth of the millionaire in Indonesia would be approximately
                                <strong>16 thousand times smaller</strong> than that of the millionaire in France.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Therefore in order to avoid confusion, I have decided to set a <strong>base currency</strong> for the project,
                                to convert all of the other world currencies into - with the intention to set a <strong>uniform measure of wealth</strong>
                                that would be most familiar to the majority of the readers.

                                Thus for purposes of this project..
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            <p>
                                The goal of this project is to analyze time, that it would take in each country to become a millionaire,
                                while living on average terms and earning an average salary. Therefore it was needed to collect relevant data
                                on <strong>average salary</strong> and <strong>average living cost</strong> per each country,
                                that would represent a true value of income, after taking into account all taxes and other required payments in each country.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was, therefore, again necessary to set standards for collecting these values,
                                in order to get meaningful results. Thus following definitions...
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Individual Profile / Calculating Cost of Living</h4>

                            <p>Calculating an average cost of living in a country can be a very complicated and lengthy process,
                                considering how many separate factors can an individual spend money on throughout one month.
                                Luckily, there are certain processes in place that are suited for computing exactly this value
                                and after consulting few of these techniques, as well as staying relevant to resolution of <strong>living below your means</strong>,
                                I have defined a <strong>base profile</strong> of an individual and his necessary spending throughout one month,
                                while keeping a reasonably <strong>average standard of living</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our base individual for this project is a <strong>single person</strong> with <strong>no kids</strong>, <strong>no debts</strong>
                                and <strong>no special expenses</strong> (e.g. taking care of parents, medicine for illness),
                                who is living in an <strong>average single bedroom apartment</strong> in <strong>non-expensive area</strong>
                                and <strong>commuting 5 days a week</strong> to a regular <strong>9-5 job</strong>.

                    First step in calculating time required for becoming a millionaire in a particular country
                    is looking at their average income and, indeed, these statistics are already a great indicator regarding
                    which countries will be most likely to be the best for becoming a millionaire

                    in close tie with <strong>Monaco</strong> ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨, another super-wealthy microstate.
                    The rest of European countries in Top 10 are (in respective order) <strong>Austria</strong> ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹, Scandinavian duo
                    of <strong>Denmark</strong> ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° and <strong>Norway</strong> ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ and finally <strong>Iceland</strong> ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¸.

                    The only 2 non-European countries to make it into top 10 are <strong>Singapore</strong> ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ on the 10th place - the Asian megalopolis and
                    an island city-state that is ranked very highly in many international rankings,

                    this is not very surprising fact. The <strong>lowest average wage in the world</strong> is earned in <strong>The Democratic Republic of Congo</strong> ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡© with only <strong>32.85$</strong> earned per month.

                <p>
                    As a second factor in our project, we consider the <strong>average cost of living</strong> in each country,
                    which is a crucial element in creating saving plans and in pursuing the goal of earning <strong>net worth of million dollars</strong>.
                    While some countries may offer an extremely high average salary, they may also be extremely expensive to live in,
                    making it difficult to put some money into saving every month. Similar situation appears in poor countries -
                    while the cost of living may be extremely low, same applies for the average wage,
                    rendering the chance of having some money to spare nearly impossible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there are exceptions when a country may offer high average income with a reasonably low living expenses,
                    as well as worst-scenario cases where high living cost meets with low income. While the latter won't be of much interest to us,
                    the former will be decisive in <strong>identifying the best country for becoming a millionaire</strong>.
                    After the first look on following tables, we can already start noticing some interesting statistics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As much as 7 countries from the <strong>Top 10 countries with highest average wage</strong>
                    have also made it to the <a class="link-main" href="#top10-highest-expenses">Top 10 countries with highest cost of living</a>.
                    <strong>Switzerland</strong>ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ with the <strong>second highest average salary</strong> in the world
                    takes also <strong>the highest average cost of living in the world</strong>,
                    while <strong>Liechtenstein</strong>ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡® moves down to 8th place in average cost of living. <strong>Monaco</strong> ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨
                    is the second most expensive place to live on average terms and <strong>Australia</strong> ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º is third,
                    with significant drop of <strong>700$</strong> from the amount required per month, compared to Monaco.
                    Along with <strong>Bahamas</strong> ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¸ on 4th place, <strong>Australia</strong> is very unlikely to be the country suitable for
                    quick and large savings. An interesting placement is <strong>Papua New Guinea</strong>ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¬
                    on 7th place with <strong>2216.34$ required per month</strong> for maintaining an average standard of living.

                    After looking at our podium we can see that the best country to become millionaire on average income
                    and in fastest time is <strong>Liechtenstein</strong> ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡®,
                    where it would take almost exactly <strong>22 years to become a millionaire</strong>. Despite a very high average cost of living
                    of <strong>2054.21$</strong>, the highest average wage worldwide of <strong>5242.14$</strong> gives an average inhabitant
                    of this country a possibility to set aside (or invest) <strong>more than 3000$ dollars each month</strong> (3187.93$ exactly),
                    making it <strong>the best country to live and work in, for aspiring millionaires</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second country is <strong>Austria</strong> ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ with <strong>29 years</strong> of work required to earn a million
                    and third <strong>Denmark</strong> ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° with <strong>3 years, 3 months and 17 days</strong> long journey towards first million.
                    We can notice that podium is entirely taken up by <strong>European countries</strong> demonstrating its strong economic balance,
                    when we look at levels of profitability between average income and average cost of living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, if we look at <strong>top 30 countries</strong> by time required to become a millionaire,
                    we'll find out that <strong>21 of them are in Europe</strong>. That says a lot about the economic stability on this continent, when compared to others.
                    Let's see what we will learn, if we look at the strength of each continent, considering <strong>top 100 countries</strong> in this ranking.

                    After answering the question that we set up to ourselves for this project, it is time to look at
                    some <strong>more interesting statistics</strong> that came up during research as well as throughout the execution
                    of our calculations.

                        <p>
                            Short answer: <strong>No</strong>. Out of 194 world countries that we have evaluated,
                            <strong>only 75 had average income higher than average cost of living</strong> and that still did not mean
                            all of these countries would provide a person with possibility of earning a million within a lifetime. For example,
                            in <strong>Bosnia and Herczegovina</strong> ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¦ - 73rd in ranking and last country with <strong>average income</strong>
                            higher than <strong>average cost of living</strong> (by only 4 euros) - it would take a person with average income and expenses
                            astonishing <strong>22 045 years, 10 months</strong> and <strong>8 days</strong> to earn a million</strong>.

                            we end up with some very interesting results.
