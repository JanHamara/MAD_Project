                    One Sunday evening, when I was browsing <strong>Medium</strong> (fantastic website
                    that curates some of the best articles on the internet on various topics), I came across
                    an <a class="link-main" href="https://medium.com/personal-finance-series-by-richard-reis/how-to-become-a-millionaire-19b1421a50a1" target="_blank">
                        article</a> discussing <strong>how one could realistically become a millionaire</strong>. It was talking about
                    some of the most important principles for achieving this goal, among which three stood out in my view.
                    These were talking about <strong>living below your means</strong>,
                    <strong>thinking long term</strong> and <strong>having more than one source of income</strong><a class="mad-ref-link" href="#mad-ref-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
                </p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="150">
                    It really got me thinking about conditions that accompany each person on their way to the first million
                    and why only so few reach this goal. After a bit more of browsing around, I have found an <a class="link-main" href="https://www.inc.com/business-insider/36-million-millionaires-in-the-world-hold-46-percent-wealth-credit-suisse-global-wealth-report-2017.html" target="_blank">
                    online report</a> from Credit Suisse that was showing how there were <strong>2.3 million new millionaires in the world in 2016</strong>,
                    putting the total at <strong>36 million</strong> millionaires in the world (2016)<a class="mad-ref-link" href="#mad-ref-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
                    That makes up less than <strong>1%</strong> of the world's population, however,
                    this one percent owns as much as <strong>half of the wealth of the world</strong>.
                    Following chart greatly illustrates this great imbalance in the distribution of wealth worldwide.
                </p>

                    Despite the widely discussed fact that <a class="link-main" href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130326-why-money-cant-buy-you-happiness" target="_blank">
                    money cannot buy you happiness</a>, everybody would surely like to be a part of this one percent
                    and become a millionaire in their lifetime. And that got me thinking about a question...
                </p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="150">
                    Depending on the environment (country) that you're coming from, having an average lifestyle
                    and by simple decision of lowering your expenses as much as possible while keeping an average standard of living -
                    <strong>Could you achieve it in a lifetime?</strong>
                </p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="150">
                    I have decided to conduct research and gather enough data to be able to determine
                    <strong>which countries wages and living conditions would allow a person to earn
                        first million in fastest time and on the other side, which country would be the worst choice.</strong>

                    There is an uncountable number of factors that can influence a journey to a point,
                    when a person can be defined as a <strong>'milionaire'</strong>. Therefore, there are several standards
                    and definitions that are needed to be explained first - to show how this research presents
                    gathered results in order to answer the set question.

                                <em>Being a millionaire</em> doesn't have to mean <em>being rich</em>
                                in certain countries of the world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While millionaire in <strong>France</strong> 🇫🇷(net worth bigger than <strong>1 000 000 €</strong>) is certainly considered worldwide as an extremely wealthy individual,
                                if we take for second example a person in <strong>Indonesia</strong> 🇮🇩 - their <strong>1 000 000 Rp</strong>
                                (Indonesian Rupiah) is barely worth <strong>62€</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This means that the actual wealth of the millionaire in Indonesia would be approximately
                                <strong>16 thousand times smaller</strong> than that of the millionaire in France.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Therefore in order to avoid confusion, I have decided to set a <strong>base currency</strong> for the project,
                                to convert all of the other world currencies into - with the intention to set a <strong>uniform measure of wealth</strong>
                                that would be most familiar to the majority of the readers.

                                Thus for purposes of this project..
                            </p>

                                The goal of this project is to analyze time, that it would take in each country to become a millionaire,
                                while living on average terms and earning an average salary. Therefore it was needed to collect relevant data
                                on <strong>average salary</strong> and <strong>average living cost</strong> per each country,
                                that would represent a true value of income, after taking into account all taxes and other required payments in each country.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was necessary to set certain standards for collecting these values,
                                in order to get meaningful results. Thus following definitions...

                            <p>Calculating an average cost of living in a country can be a very complicated and lengthy process,
                                considering how many separate factors can an individual spend money on throughout one month.
                                Luckily, there are certain processes in place that are suited for computing exactly this value
                                and after consulting few of these techniques, as well as staying relevant to resolution of <strong>living below your means</strong>,
                                I have defined a <strong>base profile</strong> of an individual and his necessary spending throughout one month,

                    Looking at <a class="link-main" href="#top10-highest-wage">Top 10 countries with the highest average wage</a>, we can immediately notice
                    that <strong>8 of them are in Europe</strong>, demonstrating its strong overall economic dominance in the world.
                    The <strong>highest average wage worldwide</strong> is in <strong>Liechtenstein</strong>🇱🇮, a German-speaking microstate in central Europe,
                    that was once known as a billionaire tax haven, nowadays much well known for its prosperous,
                    highly industrialized free-enterprise economy.
                    Its neighbouring country <strong>Switzerland</strong>🇨🇭 has the second-highest average wage,
                    also famous for being one of the most developed countries in the world, in terms of nominal wealth per adult,
                    quality of life and economic competitiveness. <strong>Luxembourg</strong> 🇱🇺 has the third place
                    in close tie with <strong>Monaco</strong> 🇲🇨, another super-wealthy microstate.
                    The rest of European countries in Top 10 are (in respective order) <strong>Austria</strong> 🇦🇹, Scandinavian duo
                    of <strong>Denmark</strong> 🇩🇰 and <strong>Norway</strong> 🇳🇴 and finally <strong>Iceland</strong> 🇮🇸.

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="150">
                    The only 2 non-European countries to make it into top 10 are <strong>Singapore</strong> 🇸🇬 on the 10th place - the Asian megalopolis and
                    an island city-state that is ranked very highly in many international rankings,
                    and is being associated with having <em>best investment potential</em>, being <em>world's smartest city</em> or
                    <em>the most technology-ready nation</em><a class="mad-ref-link" href="#mad-ref-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.
                    To much less surprise the other place with 9th highest salary goes to <strong>United States of America</strong> 🇺🇸,
                    a country with <strong>the world's largest economy by nominal GDP</strong>

                    As a second factor in our project, we consider the <strong>average cost of living</strong> in each country,
                    which is a crucial element in creating saving plans and in pursuing the goal of earning <strong>net worth of million dollars</strong>.
                    While some countries may offer an extremely high average salary, they may also be extremely expensive to live in,
                    making it difficult to put some money into saving every month. Similar situation appears in poor countries -
                    while the cost of living may be extremely low, same applies for the average wage,
                    rendering the chance of having some money to spare nearly impossible.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="150">
                    However, there are exceptions when a country may offer high average income with a reasonably low living expenses,
                    as well as worst-scenario cases where high living cost meets with low income. While the latter won't be of much interest to us,
                    the former will be decisive in <strong>identifying the best country for becoming a millionaire</strong>.
                    After the first look on following tables, we can already start noticing some interesting statistics.

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="150">
                    As much as 7 countries from the <strong>Top 10 countries with highest average wage</strong>
                    have also made it to the <a class="link-main" href="#top10-highest-expenses">Top 10 countries with highest cost of living</a>.
                    <strong>Switzerland</strong>🇨🇭 with the <strong>second highest average salary</strong> in the world
                    takes also <strong>the highest average cost of living in the world</strong>,
                    while <strong>Liechtenstein</strong>🇱🇮 moves down to 8th place in average cost of living. <strong>Monaco</strong> 🇲🇨
                    is the second most expensive place to live in on average terms and <strong>Australia</strong> 🇦🇺 is third,
                    with significant drop of <strong>700$</strong> from the amount required per month, compared to Monaco.
                    Along with <strong>Bahamas</strong> 🇧🇸 on 4th place, <strong>Australia</strong> 🇦🇺 is very unlikely to be a country suitable for
                    quick or large savings. An interesting placement is <strong>Papua New Guinea</strong> 🇵🇬
                    on 7th place with <strong>2216.34$ required per month</strong> for maintaining an average standard of living.

                    <strong>Nauru</strong> 🇳🇷, an island country in Micronesia is <strong>the smallest and wealthiest
                    independent democracy in the world</strong>, surpassing a per capita income of any oil-rich Arab nation.
                    Behind their bizarre success is a bloody tribal history, records of occupation by a succession of foreign powers
                    and an ultimate triumph of a small but determined population over ruthless practices of colonisation.
